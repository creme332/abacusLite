# 🐛 Bugs
Bug | How to reproduce | How to fix | Fixed
---|---|---|---|
Create more than 1 gap in a single column by merging beads ![](assets/beadglitch.gif)| While bead A is moving up, quickly click on bead B to cause bead B to move down. Both A and  B will merge. | Must prevent 2 beads in the same column from moving in opposite directions.  Might have to use `transitionend` event listeners.|❌
